# Which Linux ___ Should I choose?
One of the most commonly asked questions in developer communities seems to be "which Linux distro should I choose?" I've done my best here to give an objective overview of the different installation options for Linux so that you can choose as effectively as possible.

## Overview
This is a guide to help potential (and current) Linux users decide on their distro, desktop environment, and window manager.  I was originally just going to make this about distros, but I realized that many potential linux users base their decisions off of the UI. I wanted to stress that whatever distro you choose, you can set up the UI however you want.  [r/UnixPorn](reddit.com/r/unixporn) is a shining example of this.

Now I assume that if you're here, your experience with Linux is small to none, so I'm going to tell you the most important thing when it comes to picking a distro. Nine times out of ten
**IT.
DOESN'T.
MATTER.**
Got that? The vast majority of what you can do on one Linux distro you can do on the others.  And for most users, only notable difference you'll find between distros is the package manager.  There are exceptions, but like I said, I'm assuming that most readers are new to all of this.

With that being said, everybody does have their own personal preferences and picking out a new Linux distro can be a lot of fun!  So check out [DISTROS.md](distros.md) to get started!
